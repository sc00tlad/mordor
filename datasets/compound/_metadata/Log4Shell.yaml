  Datasets created while simulating a threat actor exploiting [CVE 2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228) via a JNDI Reference Java Object.
  In Log4j <= 2.14, `Message Lookups` were enabled by default creating an input validation vulnerability.
  A threat actor could take advantage of this vulnerability to make a Java application process JNDI lookups to download and execute Java objects from an attacker controlled naming service.
  There are a few types of Java objects that can be stored in a directory service.
  A JNDI reference object is one of them. A JNDI reference jave object points to the location of the Java object requested.
