The `Security Datasets` project is an open-source initiatve that contributes malicious and benign datasets, from different platforms, to the infosec community to expedite data analysis and threat research.

# Goals

* Provide open portable datasets to expedite the development of data analytics. 
* Facilitate and expedite adversary techniques simulation.
* Allow security analysts around the world to test their skills with real data.
* Improve the testing and validation of detection analytics in an easier, practical, modular and more affordable way. 
* Enable data scientists to have labeled and unlabeled data for initial research and features development.
* Help the community map datasets to other open source projects such as Sigma, Atomic Red Team, Threat Hunter Playbook (Jupyter Notebooks) and MITRE ATT&CK.
* Provide datasets for other social/community events such as Capture The Flags (CTFs) or hackathons to encourage collaboration.
